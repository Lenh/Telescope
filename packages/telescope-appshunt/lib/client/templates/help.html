  	<h2>What is AppsHunt?</h2>
  	<p>AppsHunt is a Reddit for apps. It's a place where people share the best new apps that come out, every day. You can post a new app you found and discuss with other geeks.</p>

  	<h2>How do I submit a new app?</h2>
  	<p>First of all you need to register an account on AppsHunt. Choose Facebook or Twitter to register with one simple click or create a new username if you don't have a social network profile. <br>
Once registered simply click on the "Post" button on the header of the website.</p>

	<h2>What information are needed to submit an app?</h2>
	<p>You need to give us some information before submitting a new app, such as: <br>
URL: direct link to either the home page of the app or to the store page <br>
Name: name of the app    <br>
Tagline: one sentence that describes your app <br><br>
All submissions are kept on hold and reviewed by our staff. Please, make sure to submit only new apps that just came out or that are about to come out. We are not going to accept submissions for apps that have been already out for a while or that have been covered on other sites.</p>

	<h2>Do you accept apps that are not released yet?</h2>
	<p>While we encourage to submit apps that are already available at the public, so that users can actually download them, use them and discuss them, every once in a while we reserve the right to accept apps that are about to be released.<br>
We do reccomend developers to wait until the day the app is released.</p>

	<h2>Can I update a past submission?</h2>
	<p>Not for the moment.</p>

	<h2>How does ranking work?</h2>
	<p>Our ranking algorithms are concerned with two factors: popularity (number of votes) and time (time since those votes).<br>
So: getting votes makes an item more popular, and getting older makes it less popular.</p>

	<h2>Can I comment?</h2>
	<p>Sure thing. You need to register first and then you are able to comment any apps listed as well as upvote them. You can also upvote interesting comments.</p>
