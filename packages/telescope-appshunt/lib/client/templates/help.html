  	<h2 class="help-headers">What is AppsHunt?</h2>
  	<p>AppsHunt is a Reddit for apps. It's a place where people share the best new apps that come out, every day. You can post a new app you found and discuss with other geeks.</p>

  	<h2 class="help-headers">How do I submit a new app?</h2>
  	<p>If you want to submit a new app you must be invited by an already registered member.<br>
    If you don't find anyone that can invite you try to ask directly to us by sending <a href="mailto:info@appshunt.co">an email</a> and telling us what you would like to submit.</p>

	<h2 class="help-headers">What information are needed to submit an app?</h2>
	<p>You need to give us some information before submitting a new app, such as: <br>
URL: direct link to either the home page of the app or to the store page <br>
Name: name of the app    <br>
Tagline: one sentence that describes your app <br><br>
All submissions are kept on hold and reviewed by our staff. Please, make sure to submit only new apps that just came out or that are about to come out. We are not going to accept submissions for apps that have been already out for a while or that have been covered on other sites.</p>

	<h2 class="help-headers">Do you accept apps that are not released yet?</h2>
	<p>While we encourage to submit apps that are already available at the public, so that users can actually download them, use them and discuss them, every once in a while we reserve the right to accept apps that are about to be released.<br>
We do reccomend developers to wait until the day the app is released.</p>

	<h2 class="help-headers">How does ranking work?</h2>
	<p>Our ranking algorithms are concerned with two factors: popularity (number of votes) and time (time since those votes).<br>
So: getting votes makes an item more popular, and getting older makes it less popular.</p>

	<h2 class="help-headers">Can I update a past submission?</h2>
	<p>Not for the moment.</p>
  
  <h2 class="help-headers">Why can't I comment?</h2>
	<p>Posting new apps as well as commenting is only available for users that have registered upon invitation.<br>
  If you are already registered without an invite and really want to actively participate in the community, <a href="mailto:info@appshunt.co">drop us</a> a line and we'll see what we can do about it.</p>

  <h2 class="help-headers">How do invites work?</h2>
	<p>Beta users and some selected users have been invited directly from us to use AppsHunt. These users can post new apps, write comments and invite other users.<br>
  Invited users can themselves post new apps, write comments and invite more users.</p>
  
  <h2 class="help-headers">How do I invite someone?</h2>
	<p>If you have registered after receiving an invitation you may invite other users. To do so simply go here <a href="http://appshunt.co/account">http://appshunt.co/account</a> and write your friends email addresses.<br>
  Only 3 invites per user are accepted.</p>
  
   <h2 class="help-headers">Can I receive a daily digest with the new apps?</h2>
	<p>Sure! Simply enter your email address on the home page and register for the daily digest. Check your mailbox and confirm your email.<br>
  You will receive a daily digest with the best new apps that were submitted.<br>
  Anytime, if you wish to unsubscribe, follow the link in the footer of the digest.</p>

  <h2 class="help-headers">How can I contact you?</h2>
	<p>Old way, a simple <a href="mailto:info@appshunt.co">email</a>.</p>
  
  <h2 class="help-headers">Who is behind AppsHunt?</h2>
	<p>A couple of geeks, that's about it.</p>
