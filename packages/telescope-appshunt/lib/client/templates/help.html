  	<h2 class="help-headers">What is CrowdHunt?</h2>
  	<p>CrowdHunt is a Reddit for crowdfunding projects. It's a place where people share the best new crowdfunding projects that come out, every day. You can post a new project you found and discuss with other people.</p>

  	<h2 class="help-headers">How do I submit a new project?</h2>
  	<p>If you want to submit a new project you must be invited by an already registered member.<br>
    If you don't find anyone that can invite you try to ask directly to us by sending <a href="mailto:info@crowdhunt.co">an email</a> and telling us what you would like to submit.</p>

	<h2 class="help-headers">What information are needed to submit a project?</h2>
	<p>You need to give us some information before submitting a new project, such as: <br>
URL: direct link to either the home page of the project or to the page of the crowdfunding platform where your project is hosted <br>
Name: name of the project    <br>
Tagline: one sentence that describes your idea <br><br>
All submissions are kept on hold and reviewed by our staff. Please, make sure to submit only new projects that just came out or that are about to come out. We are not going to accept submissions for projects that have been already out for a while or that have been covered on other sites.</p>

	<h2 class="help-headers">Do you accept projects that are not released yet?</h2>
	<p>While we encourage to submit projects that are already available at the public, so that users can actually back them and discuss them, every once in a while we reserve the right to accept projects that are about to be released.<br>
We do reccomend project creators to wait until the day the project is released.</p>

	<h2 class="help-headers">How does ranking work?</h2>
	<p>Our ranking algorithms are concerned with two factors: popularity (number of votes) and time (time since those votes).<br>
So: getting votes makes an item more popular, and getting older makes it less popular.</p>

	<h2 class="help-headers">Can I update a past submission?</h2>
	<p>Not for the moment.</p>
  
  <h2 class="help-headers">Why can't I comment?</h2>
	<p>Posting new apps as well as commenting is only available for users that have registered upon invitation.<br>
  If you are already registered without an invite and really want to actively participate in the community, <a href="mailto:info@crowdhunt.co">drop us</a> a line and we'll see what we can do about it.</p>

  <h2 class="help-headers">How do invites work?</h2>
	<p>Beta users and some selected users have been invited directly from us to use CrowdHunt. These users can post new projects, write comments and invite other users.<br>
  Invited users can themselves post new projects, write comments and invite more users.</p>
  
  <h2 class="help-headers">How do I invite someone?</h2>
	<p>If you have registered after receiving an invitation you may invite other users. To do so simply go here <a href="http://crowdhunt.co/account">http://crowdhunt.co/account</a> and write your friends email addresses.<br>
  Only 3 invites per user are accepted.</p>
  
   <h2 class="help-headers">Can I receive a daily digest with the new featured projects?</h2>
	<p>Sure! Simply enter your email address on the home page and register for the daily digest. Check your mailbox and confirm your email.<br>
  You will receive a daily digest with the best new projects that were submitted.<br>
  Anytime, if you wish to unsubscribe, follow the link in the footer of the digest.</p>

  <h2 class="help-headers">How can I contact you?</h2>
	<p>Old way, a simple <a href="mailto:info@crowdhunt.co">email</a>.</p>
  
  <h2 class="help-headers">Who is behind CrowdHunt?</h2>
	<p>A couple of geeks, that's about it.</p>
